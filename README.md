WifiChallenge
=============

We have been given a challenge to develop an open source solution that would be useful for all manners of 'Pirojects':

o A Raspberry Pi with a USB dongle & power supply is sent to 'non-technical person' aka the user.

o They power on the Raspberry Pi which starts up as a wireless access point, no screen/keyboard/mouse/ethernet/usb connections.

o User connects their laptop/phone via wifi to the Raspberry Pi e.g. SSID: RPi_In_A_Box, password: raspberry

o This opens a web interface that allows them to change certain settings:
    - SSID & Password for local secure wifi network
    - Static IP address
    - Flag to make Raspberry Pi boot up in ‘connect to existing wifi’ instead of ‘be an access point’ mode

o The Raspberry Pi is rebooted; connects to the local wifi and runs a script e.g. show a browser with BBC weather

o The whole system can be rebooted to web interface/admin mode (e.g. by holding a button during startup to go into admin mode)

Do any of you think you could rise to the challenge? 

We're offering a **prize of £100**, a free pint and the adulation of other RaspberryPi enthusiasts to the best demo of a solution at the next RaspberryPint on July 29th.
