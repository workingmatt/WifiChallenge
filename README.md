WifiChallenge
=============

We have been given a challenge to develop an open source solution that would be useful for all manners of 'Pirojects':

[list]
[*]A Raspberry Pi with a USB dongle & power supply is sent to 'non-technical person' aka the user.
[*]They power on the Raspberry Pi which starts up as a wireless access point, no screen/keyboard/mouse/ethernet/usb connections.
[*]User connects their laptop/phone via wifi to the Raspberry Pi e.g. SSID: RPi_In_A_Box, password: raspberry
[*]This opens a web interface that allows them to change certain settings:
- SSID & Password for local secure wifi network
- Static IP address
- Flag to make Raspberry Pi boot up in ‘connect to existing wifi’ instead of ‘be an access point’ mode
[*]The Raspberry Pi is rebooted; connects to the local wifi and runs a script e.g. show a browser with BBC weather
[*]The whole system can be rebooted to web interface/admin mode (e.g. by holding a button during startup to go into admin mode)
[/list]

Do any of you think you could rise to the challenge? 

We're offering a prize of £100, a free pint and the adulation of other RaspberryPi enthusiasts to the best demo of a solution at the next RaspberryPint on July 29th.
